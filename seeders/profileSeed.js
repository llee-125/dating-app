      'hi there,<br />,  <br />,  i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a,  zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there,  is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like,  when two people are close enough to actually sense each,  other.<br />,  i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much,  more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here,  goes.<br />,  <br />,  my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and,  adventurous. im all about my next adventure and i have a big,  appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and,  spontaneity in my day to day.<br />,  im fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. ive,  cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and,  not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. theres,  often quite a gap between story and reality. as byron katie,  likes to say: "reality is always kinder than the story we tell,  ourselves about it."<br />,  <br />,  i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left,  inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my,  bills on time and dont make too many messes in life. (well maybe,  some intentional ones, like when im finger painting with chocolate,  pudding)<br />,  if i like something, more is good, if not, theres plenty else to,  try.<br />,  i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means,  dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my,  emotions, i wouldnt trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big,  pleasure, i also like a day in my pjs every now and then.<br />,  <br />,  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine,,  its such a rich and unique alchemy. what im drawn to in a a man,  is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone whos,  comfortable enough in himself that he doesnt need to pretend,,  posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure,  enough that when hes feeling something he can share it honestly.,  at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if,  youre familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.<br />,  <br />,  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic,,  engaged, and a lot of fun. im drawn to connecting with those who,  are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to,  live, act, and make decisions from today.<br />,  we all have shadow, and one of its favorite places to show itself,  is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that,,  and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty,  quickly.<br />,  <br />,  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what im,  getting, than how im contributing, and i strive to have a positive,  impact whenever i can.<br />,  im definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also,  need some down time to hang with myself.<br />,  <br />,  although i love children, im probably not looking to have any, but,  i sure like playing with them. i wouldnt rule out relationship,  with you if youre a dad, so long as youve also got time and space,  for another significant relationship in your life.',

      "ok, heres enough info to save us a bunch of emailing and a month,  of dating. i will lay it right out there exactly who i am and what,  i want. many men thank me for my clarity and frankness. i apologize,  for the length, but its way faster in the long run. my time is,  precious and perhaps yours is as well.<br />,  (feel free to skip over the section on books, films, food, etc. or,  any other section for that matter)<br />,  <br />,  generally speaking, i am very content with myself and my life, yet,  i miss that special magic that two people can create together; and,  i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little,  and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.<br />,  <br />,  on first dates, im often told that im really easy to talk with,  and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because ive,  grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. ive worked on,  myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a,  work-in-progress, ive come a long way in myself and in my life.,  im happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i,  listen well and converse easily. im very curious about people and,  mostly non-judgmental.<br />,  <br />,  those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely,  sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm,,  grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed,,  very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny,,  multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and,  spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. im,  intense at times, but in a good way.<br />,  men often ask me how its possible that im unattached. those that,  know me really well would add that im wise, exceptionally,  sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. youll know im,  comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me.,  :)<br />,  <br />,  i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too.,  thats where the 2heartsdelight happens. youd need to be ok with,  being loved completely.<br />,  <br />,  i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of,  them aloud. im told i ask great questions.<br />,  and, i dont have a need to always have conversation in the company,  of another. im fine with just being especially once we know each,  other a bit and are comfortable with each other.<br />,  <br />,  ive developed awfully good communication skills and excellent,  relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather,  remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a,  partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your,  experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience,  w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, youre able to do the,  same. im past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in,  relationships. hopefully you are too. well process only that which,  needs to be processed together; the rest well each handle on our,  own. lets enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is,  absolutely paramount to me; life is short.<br />,  <br />,  im a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in,  the ridhwan school and also of yoga.<br />,  i have very very high integrity.<br />,  i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of,  times.<br />,  im iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.<br />,  <br />,  i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of,  the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of,  growth/transformation can be quite rapid; its kind of out of my,  hands. i dont expect you to be like me in this regard, but you,  should know and understand this and be ok with it. i am not your,  average bear.<br />,  <br />,  im realistic and im optimistic.<br />,  i no longer sweat the small stuff and most things really are small,  stuff.<br />,  <br />,  i am an independent thinker and think waaaay outside the box.,  visionary, creative, progressive,.....you get the idea.<br />,  <br />,  my life is very full and fairly well-balanced; and i have plenty of,  time for the right man. in fact, its a high priority for me to,  make time for a great man and create a great relationship,  together.<br />,  <br />,  my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid.,  im happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going,  to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to,  church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my,  orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is,  well-integrated into my being so its not critical for me to do,  spiritual things.<br />,  <br />,  im quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. ive gone,  from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist,,  do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help,,  graciously accept it when its offered, and be a feminine,  participant in the relationship. im very generous with the many,  feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of,  mutual lavishing. interesting how when theres a lot of lavishing,,  there are very few issues....... :)<br />,  <br />,  i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate,  another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship,  increase tremendously if the same is true for you.<br />,  <br />,  while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me,  in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect,,  devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity,,  humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all,  of these too.<br />,  <br />,  im really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. im,  also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too,,  this could be delightful.<br />,  <br />,  im active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill,  too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind,  of dance. if youd be willing to take partner dance lessons, id be,  thrilled!<br />,  i dont do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme,  sports. and im not interested in competition.<br />,  <br />,  i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in,  front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff,,  cooking together, baking alone or together.<br />,  <br />,  im told that although im quite mature, i have a youthfulness and,  appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few,  others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people,  usually dont believe me when i tell them my age. really.<br />,  <br />,  wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8,  wing; i am not an 8. id especially love to hear from men who are,  well-integrated 6s.<br />,  <br />,  thanks for reading all the way through.<br />,  i appreciate that its a lot to read, but i find it saves us both a,  lot of time if were really clear, self-revealing and specific.",

      'are you health conscious? the ultimate in nutritional support is,  supplements designed using your personal dna assessment. and its,  affordable. you can get information about your dna! did you inherit,  your father or mothers genetic history? or maybe not! its now,  available.<br />,  <br />,  3/21/2012<br />,  last night i took my first argentine tango lesson! jacqueline is,  this wonderful dancing buddah that teaches dance fusion at the pac.,  i took to her style of dance immediately. she mixes salsa, cha cha,,  and tango into the hour of dance, and i love it! just what the dr.,  ordered! thank you markus and dr. r. for bugging me! i have been,  reminded twice now, that dancing free style - like modern dance,,  unstructured would build some fire for me. i have been keeping,  dance fusion on my calendar for months now, trying to get it into,  my routine. i am slow to start something new, but once i make the,  commitment, i put more attention on it until its integrated into,  my life. jacqueline has been an amazing match to what i have been,  looking for, and i found her with little effort! yay! so, this is,  what i learned about myself: hopefully, you can take some of this,  away for yourself.<br />,  <br />,  i learned that tango requires of me to be present. i have to be in,  the moment. i have to focus on staying in my circle, keeping my,  attention between me and my dance partner. dont look down. dont,  think!!! dont think!!! dont think!<br />,  i noticed that my feet were doing what they were suppose to be,  doing, as long as i stepped with the music, and kept walking. keep,  my frame centered face to face with my partner. as long as i was in,  the moment, and continued to stay with my partner and be present, i,  was ok. it was a strange feeling to be "thoughtless"<br />,  <br />,  what i was doing, when i tried to think, was "chase" my partner. i,  was slightly delayed. how many times do i "chase"<br />,  my goals?<br />,  <br />,  today, i forgot to come to work for one of my most favorite,  clients. my daughter mckenna stayed home in the morning because she,  has had a tummy ache for days. she just needed to sleep in a bit,  longer. i lost track of my routine after that. my favorite auntie,  (80+ years old) was visiting my mom for lunch and we both decided,  to meet her. it was a beautiful gathering, full of joy and,  laughter, and a beautiful sunny day! then we took a walk to the,  dance store to replace mckennas shoes.<br />,  <br />,  i had this feeling that i needed to be at the shop! i kept thinking,  i have to be there, but i didnt even try to check my calendar! so,,  we went home. and, i got a phone call from my favorite client! i,  missed my appointment with her. shes forgiven me, and were,  rescheduling for tomorrow, but, i still am upset with myself! right,  now, i am mentally punishing myself for not being aware! i was,  chasing something else. i was in the moment enjoying my auntie and,  my family, and i could have been on time for my client! but, i,  didnt use my calendar to check my own schedule. im irritated with,  myself that i didnt listen to my inner guidance! how silly of me,  to have a calendar if i dont use it! everything that doesnt allow,  me to use my tools that i make to keep myself organized, let me,  destroy and uncreate that! rwgbppansbb!!!<br />,  <br />,  3/21/2012 had my first argentine dance class last night! i learn,  more about myself when i take a class like that. how much am i able,  to be in present time? thats what its all about in dance. thats,  what is all about in just about anything isnt it? i find it in my,  quilting, golf, yoga, just about anything really. being present is,  most valuable when being intimate with the one you love. ahh, what,  a sweet thought isnt it? i learned that i can easily let myself,  start thinking, which is the one thing you dont want to do with,  the argentine dance. you and your partner have to be in sync with,  the music. its romantic, passionate, present! wow!! i am ready for,  more! did you happen to watch dancing with the stars monday night!,  its going to be a good season! let me know if you are watching it,  too!<br />,  <br />,  3/12/2012 well, i am dancing now! i found this awesome dance class,  called dance fusion and jaqueline is this amazing and sexy dancer,  whos inspiring me to get my groove back! ive been taking pilates,  for a year and a half and my core is strong, but i was missing,  music in my life. yay! i am happy to fit this new hobby into my,  already full and active life! until i find my life-mate play-mate,,  ill be keeping myself busy and happy doing fun things. how does it,  get better than this? and what else is possible?<br />,  <br />,  new post as of 2/24/2012. i have a craving to take up dancing,  again. dr. orders! i used to dance all the time. any kind of dance,,  ive tried it. i would like get back into salsa or swing. i am good,  at moving my body where i want it to go. maybe someone out there,  needs a good partner. im pretty good at following. if you are,  pretty experienced, and would like to help me brush up my steps,,  id be grateful!<br />,  <br />,  previous post,<br />,  im an old soul in a young body. its taken me quite a long while,  to be comfortable to be in my own skin. i accept i am unique. i,  look younger than most women my age. i think younger. i am not set,  in my ways. i think i am open to new experiences, but with wisdom,  behind it. i push myself to open myself to new possibilities. i,  love to meet people who enjoy their life. i hope to meet like,  minded spirits who have defied the laws of nature, and bend time. i,  believe you dont have to buy into what society tries to promote. i,  want to surround myself with friends who know that they create,  their own reality. i challenge myself to break my own programmed,  thoughts that dont allow me to have a magnificent, magical life,  that i know we deserve to live. i stopped believing that life must,  be hard! i see evidence of it every day, when good things,  happen.<br />,  ive been creative always. danced, sing, art.<br />,  right now i stay fit by taking pilates 2-3 times a week. frankly, i,  am lazy when it comes to exercise. pilates is efficient, and gets,  the job done. i really want to make time for walking in nature, i,  am sure it will be good for me.<br />,  ive been in musical theater. i sang for good from wicked in front,  of 1000, and made them cry.<br />,  i volunteer for my daughters high school theater program as their,  "wig mistress" ive been in the beauty business for 40 years, and i,  help with backstage styling at their shows.<br />,  im into the healing arts, and i pay attention to energy as much as,  i can stay alert to it. i love the work that i do, and i wish i can,  do it more. i love making a difference in the lives of,  others.<br />,  im also n award winning quilter. making time for it has been hard,  in the last few years. im like an octopus, trying to manage all,  the creative avenues i want to keep moving. always learning to have,  balance.<br />,  access consciousness is a practice that has helped me to create,  more space in my thinking to allow me to do more of what i want,,  not what i need. i love being an access consciousness facillitator.,  very rewarding.<br />,  i work hard. i keep busy. im enjoying my life. the only thing that,  is missing is you! maybe! lol. im still not fully convinced that,  you are required! but, a pleasant and delightful addition to my,  life!',

      'im a bit of an intellectual, with a gregarious personality but,  remain a bit of a subversive. i have been so career focused and not,  personal-focused and thus my career is terrific but i find myself,  single and not exactly wanting to stay that way. since i tend to be,  a bit of a homebody, this internet thing seems like the wise option,  to try. i am a former buffalonian, so if you know the terms "wide,  right" or "no goal", we can cast each other knowing glances and,  shake our heads in collective shame. while i can never reform,  darwinian-imprinted sarcasm as a primary means of communication, i,  can admit that places that do not freeze in winter might actually,  be decent homes for hockey clubs. i can also tell you which english,  monarch authored the magna carta, and which grape was the genetic,  precursor to zinfandel. im an extrovert, but somehow since i,  turned 30 the homing instinct took over and now all that "stuff",  that there is to do within 10 blocks of my stoop is supplanted by,  my wildly exciting trips to the dog park or the grocery store so i,  can come home and spend all afternoon cooking.<br />,  <br />,  what im hoping for: i want a man i can laugh with daily. we have,  similar hobbies, interests, habits. we get our humor and each,  other. we communicate by mind-meld. and since mind-meld is not,  really a method of communication, we are willing to talk about,  stuff, no matter how tough it may be. when we get into an argument,  (however rare), we are able to push through it to a resolution that,  leads to kissing and heading to bed. thoughtfulness is important,  (leaving the toilet seat up), and integrity is key. i want a,  partner: one who knows himself, can manage his life, has his,  directions and pursuits, can spell and use grammar with aplomb, is,  willing to give 110% to this relationship if its worth working as,  i will, and loves my four-legged snorty, farty quadruped as much as,  i do. we dont need to agree on everything, but we can be willing,  to have each other push boundaries, and help us be better partners,  to each other. if you have nerdy, intellectual pursuits like 18th,  century british literature, stamp collecting or entymology, i might,  already be melting',

      "i was born and raised in southern africa (south africa and zimbabwe,  to be exact). i went to english boarding school at an early age all,  the way through end of high school. it was a great experience and,  many life long friendships stem from boarding school. apparently,  american boarding schools are for bad kids? the english system is,  quite different. the bad boys (that got caught, anyway) got,  expelled. ours were institutes to raise quality gentlemen and,  ladies. you will have to let me know how i turned out. so now comes,  the self-perception part: i am an easy-going, fun-loving with a big,  heart. i live life to the fullest yet maintaining a high level of,  responsibility and accountability in all aspects. i love,  international travel and typically take two or three trips,  annually. in 2011 i went to 4 different countries. that was much,  needed. i have a career that allows for a great work/life balance.,  that way i enjoy all the things outdoor activities that the bay,  area/northern california have to offer. i volunteer for a great,  organization which has been enriching for the kids within the,  program and i have grown from the experience as well. i run a,  twelve-year old wine group which is going through changes and,  revival. i was a college track athlete, so exercise is high on the,  list. i work out in the gym some days; run from my place and touch,  hoppers hands. on the return trip i do intervals, and those really,  kick butt! other times its trail running or simply hiking,  somewhere around mt tam. lastly, i can never quite decide if i,  should maintain facial hair permanently. its on my face as much as,  it is off. currently off. anything else you may want to know, by,  all means ask me.",

      "hi my name is alex. i was born and raised in the lovely suburban,  city of walnut creek, ca. now i live in beautiful downtown berkeley,  but the folks still like in the wc. im on here seeking a,  meaningful relationship with a nice guy, however impossible that,  concept finding anyone meaningful seems to me sometimes. im not,  looking for casual sex, im looking for meaningful sex but its not,  really that important in the big scheme of things as far as im,  concerned. im really looking for a cute, respectful, kind guy who i,  can become good friends with and maybe fall in love. im very,  connected and fallow news and current events as well as local bay,  area history very closely i think its very interesting as the bay,  area has a very rich history and culture. im currently a college,  student but am off for the summer. not working right now trying to,  focus on college even though i still dont have a real strong idea,  of what i want to do for a career so for now im taking digital,  photography classes at the community college known berkeley city,  college(bcc) in downtown berkeley. i was majoring in american sign,  language and had hoped to become an interpreter but doing that for,  a living is a lot of work and its very difficult and im fearful,  that might not be what i want or am ment to be doing with my life.,  its typical of people in my age range at this time to really not,  know what they want to do and with the economy being what it is,  there is a lot of uncertainty about what to do. some students are,  spending thousands on degrees that will be worthless the day they,  graduate. so im pursuing a liberal arts major which means you do a,  bit of everything. the thing i hate the most about being gay is,  that for most of the gay community it seems to all be about sex and,  has nothing to do with finding a relationship with a single person,  or something consistant and safe. instead its like people are,  trying to fuck each other over at every turn many people in the gay,  community lacking any form of unity when it comes to treating each,  other with basic human decency and respect this seems to especially,  be the case for san francisco. i dont own a car and dont plan to,  own one any time in the near future as ive decided to rely on,  sustainable forms of public transit such as bicycling, trains and,  buses. mass transit is efficient and it would have been really,  great if general motors hadnt destroyed the efficient public,  transportation options that existed in the 1940s in the us and,  instead lobbied to sell slow buses and bulldoze peoples homes and,  communities for congested ugly interstates and us highways. im,  very mature for my age and very creative. im very computer oriented,  and fairly nerdy but its great! =)",

      "i heart the letter s (silly, serious, sunny, smile, synaesthesia),  and come across as a cali dude who availed the best opportunities.,  but just like you reading this, there is far more to me than these,  words and i thought i should try to illuminate some of my truth,  here.<br />,  <br />,  my father arrived in brazil with a suitcase and eight dollars in,  his pocket in search of a better life. he was what my age is today,,  had never left his home region in india, and was a complete,  stranger in a completely strange land. what he had was knowledge,  and wisdom. my mother came in three years later; she is also a,  teacher and could have hardly imagined where their lives would take,  them. soon thereafter the dictatorship interfered in the university,  and through no fault of their own, my parents had to leave and went,  to an island city far away which is where i, their only child, was,  born and raised. it might also explain how i grew up as the only,  person with my ethnic and cultural mix that i knew of, of how i,  have three native tongues and can speak a few other accents and,  languages, and hold three citizenships today.<br />,  <br />,  my parents, who still live in brazil, gifted me with a happy,  childhood despite the turbulence we went through rough times,  during hyperinflation, moving to another small city on the other,  side of the globe and then back, a shattered family when our car,  fell off from a 200-feet cliff, witnessing the return of democracy,,  winning the one scholarship to an elite high school in the capital,,  opening one door after another, and then embarking on my own,  immigrant journey to come to the us for college. learning is the,  music of my soul; i loved everything and focused on engineering,,  medicine and business across three amazing schools. after spending,  several years creating companies and products, at the moment i work,  on investing in other peoples ideas in the heart of silicon,  valley. i know how blessed i am and i consecrate my waking hours,  to, in some small way, making a dent in the universe.<br />,  <br />,  i believe in a sound body and a sound mind. my legs have climbed,  the tallest mountain in africa; my chest fallen at 100 miles per,  hour from a plane 13,500 ft in the air, my feet swing, salsa and,  waltz; my hands bake and broil; my head likes its reading,  omnivorous and prolific. i used to compose prose and poetry but i,  dont make enough time for it these days. when i was 18 i lived and,  served for a summer in a place with little water or electricity. i,  have kept my connection and since then helped build a library, a,  high school lab and currently building a hospital there. there is,  more at http://hospitalforhope.org and,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwansywfceu; this is something i,  care deeply about and i hope to have the strength and vision to do,  a lot more.<br />,  <br />,  i have always tried living close to work because it makes my life,  happier; my 2005 hybrid takes me all around the bay and two-three,  times a week to the city. my flaws and weaknesses fill giant,  volumes that mostly only i know, i assure you they make for a,  fascinating read. =) i try to live without any regrets but i wonder,  if sometimes i fail at it. i am hoping to find a like-minded person,  who will help me always grow and that i can do the same. wish you,  the best in your search too.",

      "im a total optimist, and i tend to assume the best about everyone.,  i am often wrong, but thats ok. im good at admitting when im,  wrong and i never hesitate to apologize. constructive criticism is,  welcomed, if you can do it in a nice way. i do not argue. ever. if,  you want to know something just ask - im super open, or ill tell,  you if im not ready to answer your question. if you ask but dont,  really want to listen, ill just stop talking. i like people who,  pursue the truth and i dont spend much time with people who think,  they know it. as a nerdy science type, i like truth and i need to,  make new fact or idea fit into what i already understand about the,  world. that said, im a terrible liar, so i have trouble with white,  lies and tend to fall quiet if i dont have anything nice to say.,  but dont assume thats the case if we go out and im quiet! being,  a teacher is exhausting, and i might just be tired.<br />,  <br />,  play is a huge theme in my life. i like teaching because it is,  leading educational play. dancing and acrobatics and exploring,  nature are also all play. then theres scrabble, chess, pentago,,  etc. i dont like games of chance as much as logic games. ive,  always enjoyed playing in the dirt. i think bugs are fascinating,,  and i like plants and the occasional science experiment in my,  fridge (im not a germaphobe - i totally trust my skin and stomach,  acid to protect me). i love to go hiking and backpacking and play,  in the lab.<br />,  <br />,  i grew up with men, so i totally dont get women who spend time in,  salons. my fingernails are neat, but i dont know how to paint,  them. that said, i do enjoy having long hair, wearing dresses and,  skirts, and ill wear high heels if the occasion calls for it. ive,  got plenty of sun screen, but almost no make up. i take pride in,  being low maintenance. it doesnt take me long to get ready, and i,  tend to be on time. i dont like shopping really. i live easily,  within my means and im totally debt free with a healthy savings,  and retirement account, just in case youre worried.<br />,  <br />,  i have lots of friends here in sf, and im pretty happy with things,  as they are. you can always make a good thing better though, right?,  i would like to settle into a partnership with someone and have,  kids and all that, but doing it well is more important than doing,  it quickly. at the same time, i know that it takes a while to build,  a good relationship and i want children more than anything else in,  the world, and im in my 30s, so yes, im actively seeking a,  partner: someone to cuddle with, someone to dream big with, someone,  who wants to have a family and take the kids camping.",

      'everybody percieves me as "different"--i am a foreigner coming from,  israel. i have lived in this country for 9 years, and i have gone,  through many adventures in my life, good and bad. i love to see the,  best qualities in people i associate myself with. i love to be,  challenged by different concepts, i love analyzing literary works.,  for my self, i love challenging other peoples standpoints in life.,  i am a very intricate and a complex human being. i am very,  meticulous in details and am a very scholastic person. i like,  perfections and get upset and disappointed when i dont follow,  through with tasks or other things to perfection. it is very hard,  to forgive myself at times.<br />,  <br />,  i also have a high system of values--they are often challenged, but,  i try to be tolerant and compassionate towards people. i am highly,  sophisticated and phylosophical. love class, elegance, and,  definitely intelligence. however, i am very critical of my,  surroundings at the same time. so watch out...if you could put up,  with me, maybe its your luck...<br />,  <br />,  oh yeah, and one other detail that i cannot include in my details.,  i am a jew for jesus. let me tell you what that means, it means,  that i wholeheartedly believe that jesus is my salvation, gods,  only begotten son, who has died on the cross for our sins and,  offers salvation for absolutely no cost to you. i have strong,  jewish upbringings, and yes, i believe that jesus is the one and,  only. i have overwhelming experience that has proved that he is the,  one and only. jesus is the god, trinity in one.<br />,  <br />,  if you dont understand how it works, you better start exploring,,  because he would eventually lead you to an understanding if you,  would be open to exploring it. go to church, get the new testament,,  and read. the old testament has overwhelming details of jesuss,  coming and he will be coming back soon and judge the world. the old,  testament is the new testament concealed and the new testament is,  the old testament revealed.<br />,  <br />,  however, he is waiting on you to start exploring him. do not start,  telling me that i am religious. religion and spirituality are two,  different things. spirituality deals with the persons heart and,  mind, religion is twisted, added, subtracted, misinterpreted by,  men, who are decieved by satan. satan is real, and if you dont,  have jesus, you are very vulnerable to satans decieving you, which,  makes you sin and inobedient to gods will. god has prepared a plan,  for all of us, and we need to trust only him, which is god (jesus).,  he will protect you from all evil, but first, you must internalize,  jesus in your heart and mind and develop an intimate loving,  relationship with god, which yes, you can develop. start asking,  questions, start asking why things happen to you, start exploring,  your surroundings, and start wondering about god.<br />,  <br />,  i pray that he would draw you close to himself just as he drew,  me.<br />,  <br />,  love you all in the name of our lord, our only massiah.',

its a good one. about 16 or 17 years,  ago, i was at a party with a friend of mine, and i was talking to,  this really nice, cute and intelligent girl in the backyard. i was,  feeling pretty good about the conversation. i went back into the,  house to grab a drink, but i neglected to see the screen door was,  still closed. so, i walked straight through the doorway, taking out,  the screen door entirely from the frame, knocking it to the floor,  and landing on top of it. needless to say, i basically ran out of,  the house and waited for my friend (who was my ride) to come out,  front and haul my sorry ass away...far, far away.<br />,  <br />,  my most profound moment? one afternoon while i was still in high,  school, i was hanging out with four of my friends. we were at a,  thrift store. as i waited alone outside for my friends, this really,  old man collapsed in front of me. he was bleeding and flailing,  helplessly on the ground, so i helped him up. i asked if he needed,  help home or if i could call someone for him (obviously this was,  long before cell phones). he just paused, looked me in the face and,  said, "i have no one." he said it so earnestly and so,  matter-of-factly that this overwhelming loneliness poured over me,,  and i vowed i would never be in that position when i was his,  age.<br />,  <br />,  so, ultimately, i am looking for someone that, again, can be my,  best friend. someone who wont judge me for my faults, someone who,  wont take advantage of me, someone who will help me when things,  arent going so well, someone who will accept my help when things,  arent going so well for her, someone who laughs at the same,  twisted things that make me laugh, someone who will cry when beauty,  strikes her, someone who can just look at me and catch the subtlety,  of my emotion just from glancing into my eyes...',

      "i have a funny kind of faith about life, or myself--hard to,  describe but im here to take the whole journey and love every,  minute of it.<br />,  <br />,  5 yrs ago i put my stuff in storage and spent the last several,  years traveling and doing yoga in india (and teaching yoga,  part-time and taking care of an elderly grandma in ohio between,  india trips). i just moved back to the bay area in january with my,  dog.<br />,  <br />,  i grew up in the city and still have tons of friends from lowell h.,  s. its my first time living on this side of the bridge so im,  still just checking it out. i always came to marin on weekends so,  it kind of feels like living on vacation. also, sometimes it smells,  like tahoe (something to do with slowly toasted pine,  needles?)<br />,  <br />,  yoga is my passion and i practice mysore-style ashtanga 5 days a,  week (2 hrs in the morning, ok, fine, sometimes i sleep in) but,  take note of the fact that i am no longer a night owl. if i had an,  art its cooking. im deeply curious and tend to explore things in,  phases (like the blueberry pie phase, the italian decade, the thai,  years, the indian curry phase, or the hummus phase, etc.) these,  days its mostly the indian food phase with an emphasis on healthy,  living, but there is still plenty of variety to my tastes.<br />,  <br />,  there are so many things i love to do...travel, yoga, cooking,,  hiking, scuba diving.. but most of all i love literature, language,  and the company of quality people. i am a loyal and generous,  friend.<br />,  <br />,  my favorite thing is to share interesting experiences, entertain,  and enjoy life with the people i love.<br />,  <br />,  im smart, confident and self possessed. if you dont like,  independent women i may not be your cup of tea.<br />,  <br />,  im a flight risk (im always planning another trip to india). but,  only until my skin gets brown and then im coming home to,  california. ive negotiated myself down to long vacations.<br />,  <br />,  <em>so where have i been all your life?</em> well, im that cute,  dynamic girl you meet somewhere and youre enchanted but you find,  out she has a boyfriend. ive been in long term relationships most,  of my adult life; one for 10yrs, and another for 7 yrs--with some,  dating in between but not enough(!) phew. feels like ive been,  married twice. free at last! ive been deeply in love and have,  lived through the ups and downs of sharing life with another person,  and in that sense i really am a grown woman(funny i feel the need,  to say that at 37, but its only recently official: i am a,  grown-ass woman even though i still regularly get carded).<br />,  <br />,  <strong>i love men</strong>, but im still looking for the right,  balance of excitement, intellectual stimulation and stability. is,  it out there? im hopeful.",

      "im a tall, emotionally available grown man, but am very immature,  in some of the best (and maybe not so best) ways.<br />,  <br />,  for example, i love loud, noisy music.<br />,  <br />,  i also love to eat, and think i am particular about the quality of,  my food. but a friend recently told me that i eat like a dog,,  meaning ill eat anything put in from of me with relish (not the,  relish that tastes like sweet pickles, although i like that,  too).<br />,  <br />,  if i can ride my bicycle sixty or a hundred miles during a weekend,  (it almost never happens), ill feel like i had the best of all,  possible weekends.<br />,  <br />,  so... although im a newly minted geek, im also very comfortable,  in art galleries, and love museums, etc. im just as comfortable,  dressing up and going to the opera or symphony or the opening of a,  fancy art show, or going to see japanese heavy metal or,  whatever.<br />,  <br />,  spare time not getting outside, i love movies of all flavors, in,  theaters and on the couch. i love fiction, and feel disappointed,  that i have nearly no time to read it any more.<br />,  <br />,  some more things i love:<br />,  evenings at the ballpark<br />,  late sunday mornings in bed<br />,  swimming in the ocean<br />,  hanging out with my nephew<br />,  kittens<br />,  <br />,  im sensitive by nature, especially when others are inconsiderate,  or impatient. but i try very hard to be patient and accept other,  peoples quirks. i try my best to live an honest and straight,  forward life. im not the most outgoing person in the world, but,  neither am i awkward. i feel comfortable and engaged in most social,  situations.<br />,  <br />,  this life is such a crazy gift... i really try to make the most out,  of every moment. while i love to travel, etc, really i can get a,  huge rush from the simplest things by just stopping to notice them:,  seeing the same old glow of the sunset behind usf, or the smell on,  my own skin after swimming in the ocean, the look on my cats face,  when she gets bitten by the love bug, the smell of a sexy womans,  hair.",

      'its more fun to me to re-watch a movie with someone whos never,  seen it before than to watch a movie for the first time. im a year,  older than all my peers, because i repeated preschool. someone once,  described me as "a muppet yearning to break free of its human,  form." good manners are not outdated. i like it when people use,  complex grammatical constructions in everyday speech. the catcher,  in the rye was a stupid book. i have blue eyes. the sexiest thing,  someone can be is articulate. i was waitlisted at my school before,  getting in. my name means strong in celtic. i dont have a,  favorite food, but if i did it would be cheesecake. sometimes,  people think im flirting with them when really thats just how i,  interact. i have inside jokes with myself. if i could choose a,  super power to have, it would be perfect pitch. cats make me,  sneeze. i am actually addicted to cologne. reality tv: trashy. i am,  so bad at history. when you find an editing mistake in a movie, you,  should get to make a wish. i once kissed a smoker, but i learned my,  lesson. my favorite color is blue. i never took down those cheap,  plastic glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling from when i was,  little. i am not ticklish but i enjoy tickling people.,  double-entendres make me smile. my friends dont believe me when i,  tell them how shy i really am. i have a younger sister. when i was,  five, i named my new cocker spaniel puppy after a kid from my,  preschool class. argumentative isnt an insult. i am,  philosophically opposed to blogging (see my blog for more on this).,  my favorite word is qualia. the fact that i hold doors open for,  women doesnt mean im not a feminist. i like it when the book has,  a surprise ending that you should have seen coming but didnt. its,  spelled shaun, not sean. when someone is rude to the waiter or,  waitress, he/she is not a nice person. i fidget. while i like,  talking to new people, i am way too shy to initiate the,  conversation. i wear size-8.5 shoes. the glass is half-full, but if,  it contains a south-side cocktail, it doesnt stay that way for,  long. i used to do gymnastics. if i had to live in one place for,  the rest of my life, it would be the library of congress. i know,  absolutely nothing about cars and have no desire to learn. my new,  years resolution is to rely less on others for my own happiness. i,  cry at movies, but i didnt used to. if you know what chord a,  dominant seventh typically resolves to, youre sexy. i have a,  terrible memory. when i think no ones looking, i dance in public.,  eye contact with people i dont know well makes me uncomfortable. i,  like the kinds of jokes that make obscure references. accept no,  limits. i like singing all the time, especially in the car. tango,  is more intimate than sex. i have a tendency to be too trusting.,  poetry: yay. goatees: nay. i like my eggs sunny-sideup. roller,  coasters are awesome. it makes me happy when i rhyme,  unintentionally.<br />,  <br />,  also, i tend to only sign on when im procrastinating, so im not,  always the fastest at responding to messages.',

      'so, i guess this is where you get to know me! the first thing you,  should probably know about me is that im pretty impulsive. im,  likely to call up a friend and say "hey, lets go to an open house,  and pretend to be a couple." and then speak in a french accent the,  whole time.<br />,  im kind of shy and awkward when you first meet me, but once i,  start talking to someone (or once i have a few drinks in me), im a,  very open-book kind of person. i open up fairly easily, but i,  definitely dont expect that from the people around me. i love,  really intimate conversations though, so it usually helps if the,  other person opens up, even just a little bit. one of the first,  things youll figure out about me is that i have a very odd sense,  of humor. ill joke about almost anything (except for a few really,  horrible things), but its really easy for me to be serious when,  the situation calls for it.<br />,  a few fun facts about me: the first thing i do in the morning is,  curse my alarm clock; i hate that thing. i once shaved my head,  (that was fun!). i have a really fierce cat named glenn coco, and,  thumbs up if you know where that name is from :). i love bodies of,  water, and no matter what im wearing, i will usually jump in one,  if its around.<br />,  <br />,  p.s., i cant take credit for creating my username; its the name,  of my favorite character on robot chicken :)<br />,  <br />,  p.p.s., i always forget to sign my name on messages, so my name is,  deena.',

      'and when you appear,<br />,  all the rivers flow in my body,<br />,  bells shake the sky,<br />,  and a hymn fills the earth.<br />,  <br />,  that verse, the last stanza of the queen, by pablo neruda, pretty,  much defines why im here and what im looking for. having once,  known that kind of love, and having blown it, i know how rare it,  is. but if it happens, i wont blow it a second time. im not here,  for one of those plain vanilla, low-conflict, low-passion affairs.,  my membership in okc is but one component of my search for someone,  who will knock my sox off, blow me away and shake me to my,  foundation. thats a tall order. but, as i wrote, my okc search is,  but one component. and i will not settle. most of all, i would be,  delighted to find someone with a very pronounced right brain.,  thats my bias.<br />,  <br />,  "its beautiful to take a chance<br />,  and if you fall, you fall.<br />,  and im thinkin<br />,  i wouldnt mind at all.<br />,  and that would be, but beautiful"<br />,  <br />,  that short verse, from"but beautiful," a jazz classic that has been,  covered by every vocalist who matters, pretty much summarizes where,  im at in my life and in my quest. i have learned to open my heart,,  no matter what, and be prepared to lose it all in order to win it,  all.<br />,  <br />,  by the way, some of you might remember my first incarnation on,  okcupid as roiphe. that profile was roiphe 1.0; this profile is,  roiphe 2.0, under the name of bobwhite1081. okc took roiphe 1.0,  down because i flaunted the rules by using alias photos instead of,  my own pics. i used james dean, jon hamm, cary grant, humphrey,  bogart, peter sellers (as dr. strangelove), and alsace man with,  corkscrew, a ralph steadman painting, among others. more than a few,  busybodies (some of whom had no pictures at all on their own,  profiles) ratted me out to okc. it happened one too many times and,  okc took down my roiphe profile. so this time, the pic you see on,  this profile is a self-portrait, of yours truly, shot by yours,  truly.<br />,  <br />,  im someone who lives fully in the senses. whatever i do, i do with,  passion. otherwise, why bother? this isnt a dress rehearsal; its,  the real deal and our one and only shot. thats why im a foodie;,  its why im into wine; its why i drive a ragtop. whats better,  than the wind in your hair and the sun on your face? well, actually,  there are a few things better but thats a conversation we can have,  when we meet. im into jazz in a big, big way and attend quite a,  few concerts presented by sfjazz, the countrys best jazz festival,,  if not the worlds. i also have a rather large and growing,  collection of jazz cds. i just bought "the shearing piano," a,  george shearing cd with a version of "stella by starlight" that,  will give you goosebumps. i also just acquired "bennett sings,  ellington" by tony bennett. it has a version of "prelude to a,  kiss," a song ( and arrangement) that displays vocal mastery that,  only artists one can count on one hand possess. i listen to jazz,  constantly, at home and in my car. id do it at the office but,  streaming music or video takes up too much of the companys network,  bandwidth and i get nasty messages from it if i do it. maybe ill,  start taking cds to work with me. i dread the possibility that mp3,  will become the standard format for music and am actively buying,  cds while i still can, before they too become museum pieces,  alongside vinyl.<br />,  <br />,  i love to kiss, and if i do say so myself, im awfully good at it,,  as ive been told more than once. i love to stretch out on the sofa,  with a mature (60-68), sexy woman and kiss for long stretches of,  time. i love to kiss until i ache. i love the ache. by the way, im,  not looking for a younger woman. but i want to sincerely thank the,  guys my age who are looking for a younger woman. they leave the,  real women for me. as my father used to say, theres no fool like,  an old fool.<br />,  <br />,  i have lots of cool kitchen toys and know how to use them all. but,  i also love to try new restaurants and new things to eat that i,  havent tried before. if one of them really knocks me out, i try to,  replicate it. for not having been professionally trained, im one,  of the better, non-professional chefs around. but i make an unholy,  mess in the kitchen when im cooking. as you probably know, there,  is a strong movement in the culinary world to use fresh, locally,  grown foods in the kitchen. this is a beautiful thing. but its not,  the only thing. without proper technique, all you get is a bad meal,  made from good stuff. technique is everything. by the way, i hold,  the secret to making perfect french fries. perfect is not an easy,  trick, but i know how to achieve it, for french fries anyway.<br />,  <br />,  but the kitchen isnt the only room in which i have skills. im,  handy in every room in the house. modest too, you might have,  noticed by now.<br />,  <br />,  besides being able to cook, i know my way to the dry cleaners. i,  know how to operate the vacuum and the washer and dryer. my,  interest in finding a match has nothing to do with those,  things.<br />,  <br />,  politically, im a yellow dog, which means that im about as,  liberal as you can get. but i am no longer a democrat. im too,  liberal for them. heres a quote from mark twain that seems,  appropriate for the present times: in the beginning of a change,,  the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. when,  his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing,  to be a patriot. clearly, the real patriot is scarce; so scarce as,  to be almost nowhere to be found, despite the assertions of so many,  who lay claim to the title. but they are hijackers, claiming their,  definition is the only true definition.<br />,  <br />,  here are some other quotes i like:<br />,  if youre going to walk on thin ice, you may as well dance ,  anon<br />,  "you were once wild here. dont let them tame you!" - isadora,  duncan<br />,  "dance, when youre broken open. dance, if youve torn the bandage,  off. dance in the middle of the fighting. dance in your blood.,  dance when youre perfectly free." - mawlana jalal-al-din,  rumi<br />,  dont ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes,  you come alive. and then go and do that. - howard thurman<br />,  you can have anything you want if you want it desperately enough.,  you must want it with an exuberance that erupts through the skin,  and joins the energy that created the world. -sheila graham<br />,  passion is universal humanity. without it religion, history,,  romance and art would be useless. - honor de balzac<br />,  our passions are the true phoenixes; when the old one is burnt,  out, a new one rises from its ashes. - johann wolfgang von,  goethe<br />,  "love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks,  simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses." - lao tzu<br />,  "an inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining,  young" - oscar wilde<br />,  a man who is able to control his passions is a man whose passions,  are weak enough to be controlled. - william blake<br />,  "of all the worldly passions, lust is the most intense. all other,  worldly passions seem to follow in its train." - buddha<br />,  be still if you have nothing to say; when true passion moves you,,  say what youve got to say and say it hot. - d.h. lawrence<br />,  there is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a,  life that is less than the one you are capable of living. - nelson,  mandela<br />,  we must act out passion before we can feel it. - jean-paul,  sartre<br />,  nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without,  passion. - georg wilhelm friedrich hegel<br />,  better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of,  some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. - james,  joyce<br />,  man is only great when he acts from passion. - benjamin,  disraeli<br />,  honest criticism means nothing: what one wants is unrestrained,  passion, fire for fire. - henry miller<br />,  death is the only pure, beautiful conclusion of a great passion.,  - d. h. lawrence<br />,  when a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each,  other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as,  parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of,  nature, and are lovers by divine right, in spite of human,  convention or the laws. - nicolas de chamfort<br />,  it is the souls duty to be loyal to its own desires. it must,  abandon itself to its master passion. - rebecca west<br />,  the only sin passion can commit is to be joyless. - dorothy l.,  sayers<br />,  the voice of passion is better than the voice of reason. the,  passionless cannot change history. - czeslaw milosz<br />,  any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply,  not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. - albert,  einstein<br />,  the decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any,  love story. it changes the relationship of two people much more,  strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already,  has within it that surrender. - emil ludwig<br />,  a kiss is the upper persuasion for a lower invasion. - anon<br />,  where should one use perfume? a young woman asked. wherever one,  wants to be kissed, i said. - coco chanel<br />,  a legal kiss is never as good as a stolen one. - guy de,  maupassant<br />,  soul meets soul on lovers lips. - percy bysshe shelley<br />,  kisses are like tears, the only real ones are the ones you cant,  hold back. - anon<br />,  stolen kisses require an accomplice. - anon<br />,  i ran up the door, opened the stairs, said my pajamas and put on,  my prayers - turned off my bed, tumbled into my light, and all,  because he kissed me good-night! - unknown<br />,  dont have sex man. it leads to kissing and pretty soon you have,  to start talking to them. - steve martin<br />,  <br />,  i have lots more quotes but youre not in a library, or your,  favorite nook, reading a treasured book. this is a profile, not a,  novel. ill give you more if you ask, but theres more ground to,  cover in this profile if i am to reveal myself as fully as possible,  with only the written word. the remainder of the revelation will,  have to wait until we meet. but first, one last quote ( which i,  shamelessly stole from another okc member whom i found captivating,  and alluring): there are only four questions of value...what is,  sacred? what is the spirit made of? what is worth living for, and,  dying for? the answer for each is the same. only love." - johnny,  depp from the movie don juan de marco.<br />,  <br />,  im not crazy about the overly casual mode of dress that seems to,  have overtaken our culture. everyone seems to be wearing sweats,  these days. i wear them too, but never in public. and its a rare,  day that i even wear jeans in public. seems like there are more and,  more candidates for an intervention by tracy and clinton every day.,  enough! time to show a little class when out in public.<br />,  <br />,  i am highly tactile, visual, oral, aural, and olfactoral. i live in,  the senses, for the sensory. i sometimes sit for hours, lights low,,  phone unplugged, and listen to jazz. its a musical form that is,  not wallpaper. it demands your attention. i listen until the music,  enters me.<br />,  <br />,  i believe that lovemaking begins with hello. it progresses with,  glances, whispers, light touches (the skin is the most sensitive of,  erogenous zones), laughter, teasing, double entendres, a shared,  meal of food eaten with ones hands, dancing close at halftime to,  the beat, a few sweet kisses. it is high art in a world in which,  most people are streetsweepers.',

      'ok, heres the skinny in the default world:<br />,  most of my closest friends have always been guys. so i fall into,  the girl next door category, i guess. but the thing i like about,  guys is that they are far more easy to get along with than girls.,  what you see is what you get. and thats what im about. if i had,  to sum myself up in one phrase, it would be "no bullshit." now that,  im older, however, i have a lot more women friends.<br />,  <br />,  i have a lot of energy and tend to do things quickly and loudly.,  im a total smart ass and i love to banter. if im being too nice,  and agreeable, then i probably dont like you. if i insult and/or,  offend you, then you know youve made it into the fold. all in good,  fun and humor, of course. ;)<br />,  <br />,  i have a separate part of my brain that houses useless 80s movie,  quotes and song lyrics. yes, i know. im a nerd. i also majored in,  latin/roman ancient history, so there you go.<br />,  <br />,  anyone i date must have a keen sense of humor. i try not to take,  myself or life too seriously. im a very social person and love to,  talk. im the girl who will belly-up to the bar next to the regular,  war veteran and extract their life story.<br />,  <br />,  i do not lie and cannot stand being lied to. if you cant level,  with me and tell me the truth, then you dont respect me. im a big,  girl; i can take it.<br />,  <br />,  heres the skinny in the other world:<br />,  on the inside, i am much softer than id like to admit. i am quite,  spiritual and am aiming to shed my armor to let the light in. i am,  looking for someone who helps me feel grounded and beautiful. i,  have yet to go to the playa, but am feeling more drawn to the,  burner crowd these days, so that is probably in my future. in a,  nutshell, im dusting the dirt off and spreading my wings. who,  wants to fly with me?<br />,  <br />,  by the way, i am not a woman whose biological clock is ticking. i,  think that bringing a child into this world is a big decision best,  made mutually between the parties involved. i am simply looking for,  someone to hold me when its dark. everything else is gravy.',

      "im still at that stage in my life where what i care most about is,  when the next party is. i had a long distance relationship for a,  while but i felt tied down sooo im not looking for a relationship,,  im just looking for people to chill/hang out with.<br />,  <br />,  i guess that makes me sound pretty immature but i do have,  aspirations as well. as a biologist i really love to think about,  how life works and im especially interested in evolution (so no,  creationists please!) and behaviour (yes im british, so i believe,  that is the correct spelling :p). one day id like to travel the,  world and work with animals, perhaps study the behaviour of chimps,  in the amazon or something?",

      "people have described me as funny, witty and possessing of a,  personality. i try to keep in shape but relaxation, leisure,,  crosswords and losing at chess really make me tick.<br />,  <br />,  a strong cup of hot, black coffee and a stiff drink (not,  simultaneously) will always catch my attention. technology doesnt,  interest me much (for example, i think its gay to check-in at,  places through my phone and do facebook updates every hour).<br />,  <br />,  i can be a tremendous smart-ass and prefer girls who are the same,  way. youve got to dish it out and take it.<br />,  <br />,  as far as being active, i hike/run/walk regularly with my dog. i,  love tennis and have developed a pretty decent game through a long,  stint of unemployment and grad school. i can ski and ride a horse,  (again, not simultaneously) but havent done either in a,  while.<br />,  <br />,  what else interests me? i like the arts, culture and anything that,  is out of the ordinary. for example, i like antique wooden and,  leather furniture. if i can ever manage to make any money, i will,  have a study room full of old furniture, oil paintings and,  taxidermied animals where ill drink stiff cocktails and read, do,  crosswords or watch television. eccentric types intrigue me as do,  other right-brained types... i get along well with animal-lovers,,  smart asses and those who dont take themselves to seriously.",

      "i spent ten years in new york (most recently brooklyn) and moved,  out here about three years ago. after the first 6 months i realized,  i was never moving back. i love california and taking advantage of,  all awesome it has to offer - camping, biking, hiking, oceans, or,  just hanging out in the park. i like getting out just as much as,  lying on the couch with a good movie, but it really depends on the,  day that led up to it.<br />,  <br />,  reserved, quiet, and boring are words that youll never hear used,  to describe me (and hopefully not you either). im really,  extroverted and despite my best efforts, i wear my emotions on my,  sleeve. i try to surround myself with great people and really enjoy,  hanging out with my friends no matter what were doing. ive been,  cooking a ton lately and ill make you the best pork chop youve,  ever had.<br />,  <br />,  im looking for someone who can have fun doing anything from,  jumping off a rope swing in bass lake, loading up the jukebox at a,  dive bar, going on bike rides, cooking something awesome, or,  packing up the car for a last minute road trip.<br />,  <br />,  seriously though, you must enjoy road trips and camping.",

      "i love cooking local food from the farmers market for the people in,  my life. as much as i love cooking, i will never say no to a nice,  dinner out with a glass of wine. i think outside patios on sunny,  days are a perfect location to spend an afternoon drinking a beer,  especially after a hike. i was born and raised in the east bay but,  i have lived in enough other places to know that the bay area is,  where my heart is. with that said, my heart is equally attached to,  ecuador where i lived for a year. i am pretty happy building a life,  in the bay but would love to live again in another country.<br />,  <br />,  my preferred exercise is something outside - hiking, swimming or,  rock climbing. although i love being outside, i have been known to,  swap out my climbing shoes for my salsa shoes and go out dancing,  all in the same evening. i am a pretty positive, easy-going person,  and try not to sweat the small stuff.<br />,  i try to be as environmental conscious with how i live my life as,  possible and tread lightly on this earth.<br />,  <br />,  heres a list of things that make me happy and get me excited...,  hiking in redwoods, lazy sunday mornings with coffee, yoga, dinner,  parties with good friends, stern grove concerts, independent films,,  working in my garden, an after work glass of wine or a beer at a,  dive bar, dancing either at home or out with friends, cooking for,  others, camping, full moons, singing in the car, belly laughter.",

      'hello ok cupid people!<br />,  <br />,  im baaack.<br />,  <br />,  just poking around a little here and there though.<br />,  im not really sure if i can take this site too seriously.<br />,  however, my twin sister did meet the love of her life on here so,,  yeah, that may be the reason why im still here.<br />,  <br />,  in all honesty, ive attempted to write a "self-summary" a few,  times for a few different social networking sites (this would be,  the only dating site that ive ever graced though). ive realized,  that it is exceedingly difficult to accurately describe myself,  because, although i feel that i am more introspective and,  self-aware than most, i have my blind spots and faults that i am,  not willing to admit to online.<br />,  <br />,  so, this summary will just have to do for now. i will probably read,  it in a few months and decide that it doesnt do me justice anymore,  and then make changes accordingly. i am the proverbial chameleon:,  the world keeps on changing and i change along with it.<br />,  <br />,  here are my ramblings:<br />,  <br />,  i often ponder, "what is the point of my life?"<br />,  <br />,  love is the main answer that i come up with consistently.<br />,  <br />,  there are so many kinds of love and im still discovering new ways,  in which to love. i know that i love deeply and once i have decided,  that i love you, i will love you forever.<br />,  and i am not just referring to romantic love. familial and platonic,  love are just as important to me.<br />,  <br />,  i am openly affectionate. i like pda- being a participant as well,  as a voyeur. my favorite is spotting old-timers holding hands,  tightly as they walk through the street or seeing two people, with,  lots of chemistry, in the beginning of their relationship (before,  any kissing) finding ways to make physical contact with each,  other.<br />,  <br />,  music is another answer.<br />,  <br />,  almost every one of my memories has a song that goes with it. i,  sing constantly because it keeps me happy (and sane hah!). life,  without music is not a life worth living. i dance a lot. most of it,  is in the privacy of my apartment, but i do like to go out and,  shake my booty once in a while. on a side note, im not much into,  "the scene" anymore. drunk men trying to bed me has become,  laughable given my many years experience as a bartender. ive heard,  just about every pick up line and seen almost every approach one,  could take to bed another. if you treat me like i am a sentient,  human being and not just boobs, an ass and a vagina with legs, then,  we might get along... maybe.<br />,  <br />,  believing is another answer.<br />,  <br />,  i believe that the world can be better. i believe that we all can,  make a difference. i believe that people want to be good to each,  other, but sometimes we get in the way of ourselves. i believe in,  being the change that you wish to see in the world. i believe that,  we should take care of each other. i believe in the,  interconnectedness of all beings and that every decision i make,  affects the whole world in varying degrees.<br />,  <br />,  overall, id say that never really having all the answers- the,  mysterious, the unknown, the inconceivable- this is what life is,  all about. i often remind myself that it is okay to not know. it is,  okay to be unsure about someone or something. it is okay to just,  wade in that big, gray area.',

      "i am an engineer, living in san francisco. i love computers and,  outdoor activities. on a good day i loves solving puzzles, or,  picking up my motorcycle/mountain bike and go riding. i also love,  hiking, chatting with friends, watching movies and occasionally,  cooking. in general i think i love being outdoors. while i have my,  days when i want to sit at home, but most of the other days i am,  just doing something or the other.<br />,  <br />,  i am not necessarily looking for a hook up (atleast an immediate,  one). i would love to be friends, and if we hit up together, i am,  more than happy to get into a relationship!<br />,  <br />,  this thing is more difficult than it looks. everything that i want,  to write feels so cliche, even saying that you should talk to me to,  know me!<br />,  <br />,  aside from these hobbies and activities, i am mostly try to engage,  in something which challenges my intellect and makes me think.,  while a large part of it comes from talking to people and reading,  (not just books, but random stuff off the internet), some of it is,  just observation. however, i have a very short attention span,,  unless something really interests me. perhaps thats why i love,  visiting places as a traveler? so far i have done 14 states, and,  this year i am hoping to do 1-2 more countries and a couple of more,  states. anyone up for that?<br />,  <br />,  ps: i can publish reports over a 100 pages long, but i can not fill,  in 1000 words about myself :-(",

      'my summary had been written at least 5 years ago. finally, ive,  updated and revised it, and here it is! (sometime i have to go,  through a thousand some odd questions to check how my answers may,  have changed.)<br />,  <br />,  im a programmer, geek, and gamer- that means ive spent a lot of,  time in front of screens. id like to get out to do things, and,  someone to go with! urban hikes, eating out, going to movies,,  sometimes road trips. ive gone for ballroom dancing in the past,,  and want to find the time to go again.<br />,  <br />,  but, im also a bit of a homebody, with plenty of hobbies for when,  i stay in. besides video games (which im trying to cut back on for,  these other hobbies), im also into cosplay- sewing my own,  costumes, fabricating my own props, and wearing them to,  conventions.<br />,  <br />,  part scientist, part artist- in my work, sometimes i am reducing a,  problem mathematically to an elegant solution. in costuming, im,  self-taught from an engineers eye. i also have some skill with,  drawing and sketching. it all helps balance me out.<br />,  <br />,  other hobbies include cooking and baking, and im quite proud of,  the pies and cheesecakes ive made.<br />,  <br />,  im a rather positive person, and can get along with people quite,  different from me. i dont watch tv, but i do watch movies,,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=anime">anime</a>, and things on,  netflix. im not big into sports, but im no hater- its just not,  my thing. i have little to no patience for drama. i do like,  independent, kind &amp; caring women. preferably a gamer, geekette,,  or somewhat nerdy (if so self-described).',

      'i waiting for my father to arrive for a sunday morning brunch, so,  why not spend a little time here. im a warm-hearted,,  people-oriented person. i deeply value time alone, but my life,  really is about heart-centered connections. i choose my,  relationships carefully, but i can find something to like in,  everyone. and all that being said, im actually not hugely,  extroverted! i can even be a little shy sometimes. - like at a big,  event where i dont know anyone. but i find joy in connecting and,  feeling your heart and mine.<br />,  <br />,  i am adventurous! i love to travel and try new things! the best,  thing i have ever done was take an 8-month hiatus from my job and,  go traveling around the world, alone, with 3 outfits in my,  backpack. i was 39 - one of the older backpackers on the trail -,  but met amazing people and learned more about myself and life than,  i ever had up until then. and im not done traveling! definitely,  looking for someone who wants to share this passion. i like to,  travel simply, off the beaten path, trying new foods, meeting,  people, and spending most of my time walking.<br />,  <br />,  i am not religious, but consider myself deeply spiritual. (strange,  that that isnt an option on okc.) what that means to me either,  resonates with you or is deserving of a conversation.... but mostly,  it means that i believe in an intelligent and benevolent universe.,  doesnt mean we run around manifesting stuff aka "the secret!" but,  life does give us what we ask for, im certain. and i want joy,,  consciousness, generosity, compassion, kindness, love, and the,  capacity to embrace the experiences of the opposites of those,  qualities when they show up.<br />,  <br />,  as for relationship... i have had deeply fulfilling relationships,,  and each one has taught me about myself and life. i suppose thats,  really the point -- enjoying connection and intimacy while learning,  about ourselves. id like to find a partnership that is lasting and,  learned a lot about what that takes in my last relationship....,  (but we will see what life has in store for me. :) ) but would be,  good to say more here about what sort of partner and what sort of,  relationship i want, right? bill have to come back to that later,  today....',

      "hello and thank you for your interest in me as a potential friend,  or romantic partner. id like to focus first on the kind of,  relationship im wishing to create. sharing a passion for a similar,  ideal of relationship is more attractive to me than a particular,  age, race or body type.<br />,  <br />,  tenderness: i dont fit the typical stereotype of a guy. i am very,  effective at what i do (built my first custom house on time and on,  budget at age 24, for example, acting as my own contractor) and,  mentally very intelligent. however, i use these skills to create,  serenity, harmony, avoid unnecessary conflict and create a,  micro-climate that supports emotional tenderness, appreciation,,  reflection and beauty. on a relationship level i am most interested,  in how you treat your inner children, your kindness with yourself,  and others and the priority you place on a quiet joy with,  another.<br />,  <br />,  depth and togetherness: i enjoy beginning a relationship with the,  generous time needed for full transparency emotionally, mentally,  and logistically. i can feel kindness when it is present almost,  instantly and hope you can do the same. the more aware and visible,  two kind people are the more consciously and skillfully we can,  navigate around or sooth each others tender sides and bring value.,  i like to consciously create containers that provide generous time,  to explore each others faces mentally, emotionally, physically and,  spiritually. to do this it is best if both people have at least an,  hour a day particularly in the building period of getting to know,  one another and an average of thirty hours each week to ebb and,  flow without external pressures.<br />,  <br />,  conscious collaboration: it is wonderful when the two of us,  naturally flow into a dance that is highly rewarding and satisfying,  to both people. i appreciate this element in a relationship to some,  degree. just as importantly i want to collaborate to co-create,  conscious value sexually, emotionally, mentally and in our daily,  logistics. i find it enormously satisfying to take the time to,  communicate what optimal looks like for each of us and then,  collaborate as a team to bring more of this into our relationship.,  the willingness and ability to coach and be coached is a key skill,  needed to do this well.<br />,  <br />,  celebrating our unique well-being: i appreciate a self-aware,  partner who understands and is willing to go for what makes her,  deeply happy. this is an infinite path and one i enjoy working on,  together. i have lived most of my life outside of convention and,  find that the willingness to put personal values and unique,  strategies ahead of trying to look or be normal is one of my keys,  to happiness. i would love to connect with others who are also free,  to seek happiness beyond convention.<br />,  <br />,  integrity: i find it particularly important in our diverse culture,  to take the time to co-create agreements and understandings that,  support both of us in meeting our needs and experiencing our values,  fully within the relationship. i feel that the skill to communicate,  in ways needed to form clear agreements based on win/win and then,  keep those agreements and renegotiate them responsibly as the,  relationship grows is vital. i want the kind or relationship in,  which we can rely upon each other to bring up anything that needs,  to be said, to speak the full truth, to keep our commitments and,  not to make commitments that are not in alignment with our hearts,  desires. this obviously takes time to do well in the moment and i,  wish to be with someone that puts this respect and integrity above,  all else in our lives. i am looking for a partner interested in,  creating a relationship that deserves to come first in both our,  lives and that is given first priority. i have set up the logistics,  of my life to be able to meet you here.<br />,  <br />,  staying present now: i want our relationship to feed our souls, to,  bring us deep joy, inspiration and well-being now. i have loved,  several very beautiful women, inside and out. having done,  joint-therapy with five of them my therapist tells me i have great,  taste in incredible women. i would have been happy if any one of,  those women had stayed with me for the rest of my life. this is not,  my highest value however. my highest value is the daily, weekly and,  yearly assessment: is this relationship taking each of us where we,  want to go? is it supporting us in being who we want to be? can we,  make adjustments to see that it does and are we willing to do so?,  whether for a week, a month, a year or decades, i come into,  relationship when the two of us believe and experience that doing,  so takes us closer to our values. i end relationship when i do not,  see or experience this for both people. i do not consider death to,  be a failure and appreciate the vitality that comes from honestly,  exploring the question: does spending time together each day bring,  us more value than any other thing we could be doing? if not, why,  not? are we ok with that or do we want to reinvent our relationship,  so that it does? immediacy is a very high value of mine. something,  that is true and gets communicated while im feeling it is a great,  experience. within the next 24 hours its ok and beyond that it,  begins to feel stale and intimacy starts to diminish.<br />,  <br />,  appreciation and affection: my first three love languages in this,  order are: words of praise, quality time and touch. to feel loved i,  need verbal appreciation, spacious time to connect and touch.,  because i get a fairly good read on someone within a few hours i am,  often fairly fast with affection if i feel safe and it is nice to,  be met there. i enjoy leisurely relationships in which we take the,  time each day to appreciate what we love about one another and to,  enjoy sexual and sensual affection. i notice that i dont have a,  courting and honeymoon stage that wears off. i am just as,  affectionate several years into a relationship as i am at the,  beginning sometimes more so because i get turned on more by,  emotional closeness than i do by anything else.<br />,  <br />,  personal growth and spirituality: i am passionate about learning,  exceptional relationship skills and have published several books on,  the subject as part of my own education (i learn best by teaching).,  it was an incredible discovery when i experienced natural sacred,  states of insight and consciousness arising out of bringing our,  energy bodies into love-making. i have learned so much in the past,  eight years since i made relationship skills the focus of my,  life-long learning program. i want to meet someone who shares my,  passion to learn and experience new things on all dimensions. i,  have always found i learn best with beginners mind. i appreciate,  you for joining me there.",

    essay:
      'i am an experienced dom seeking a partner who would like to submit,  to me in the bedroom.<br />,  <br />,  outside of the bedroom, i work full time, at a job that i enjoy,,  bicycle, read, watch plays/movies, attend jazz performances, play,  scrabble, cook, travel, visit art museums and hike. to add a,  dimension to the places i visit, at night i often read stories,  about the areas. although, i dont own a tv, i sometimes watch,  movies on my heavily customized mac.<br />,  <br />,  all year i love hiking. in the area, i especially enjoy exploring,  mt. tam and yosemite. when im not outside you can often find me in,  a museum. im a member of the sf moma and the de young. i have,  lived in two other countries. i love sfs blend of ethnically,  distinct neighborhoods, topographically rugged parks and proximity,  to places that at least feel like the wilderness. thats why i,  settled here.<br />,  <br />,  i have a liberal political view, read the op-ed page of the new,  york times almost every day and am environmentally/health,  conscious.<br />,  <br />,  i seek a partner who wishes to be submissive with me in the,  bedroom. in terms of d/s, my partners always had a great deal of,  power and likewise, i have a lot of power. when playing, i do not,  feel that they give me their power. instead they give me the,  authority to direct that power or surrender that power to me. there,  is a subtle but important distinction between the idea of "power,  exchange" and what im describing. its like when riding a horse,,  the horse is still powerful but the horse is allowing its rider to,  direct its energy.<br />,  <br />,  in addition to theory, i have also had a significant amount of,  experience. ive been in the "scene" since may 2004. since then,,  ive been in two successive, exclusive, long-term relationships for,  a total of more than four years. my former partners and i still,  communicate and occasionally see each other but not to play. to,  learn about bdsm, i attended numerous classes and events. after,  classes i practiced what i learned. ive also been bound, caned,,  flogged, hooded, mummified, spiced (as in spice play), etc. this,  has given me a perspective on what the bottom is going,  through.<br />,  <br />,  in addition, i took a male dominant intensive taught by pro female,  dominants. much of the intensive was hands-on and the pro-doms,  critiqued the students technique, energy and awareness. there were,  normally three teachers and six students. i learned that being,  emotionally/mentally present during play is more important than,  technique. the feedback during the class was often harsh but i,  learned a great deal and am glad that i did it, because it made me,  a much better dom.<br />,  <br />,  i take d/s and bdsm fairly seriously. i dont take myself very,  seriously though and when i make mistakes, i readily apologize. i,  always play with safe-words, use condoms, wash my toys, respect,  limits, etc. also, im a member of the society of janus and had a,  mentor during my first year in the scene. references from women,  ive played with are available.',

      '[i am currently seeing someone and being monoamorous have changed,  my settings, but i have not rewritten my profile to remove dating,  references. feel free to contact me if you feel friendly or,  complimentary.]<br />,  <br />,  trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.,  alan watts<br />,  <br />,  some wordy teeth-biting: i like to think i dont fit into standard,  categories. by the standards of the midwestern suburbs of my youth,,  im a bit of a bohemian, bookish, ex-sort-of-hippy semi-nerd who,  has lived a somewhat untraditional life, segueing from a career in,  publishing into doing html/css/photoshop/animation for websites,  (and sometimes designing and editing them as well). until a funding,  apocalypse i was also managing editor of an online magazine and,  wrote some science journalism. my friends and co-workers include,  science fiction fans, authors, art directors, programmers, game,  designers, used book dealers, underground comic artists, and former,  associates of timothy leary. on the other hand, compared to many of,  them, im more on the square and conventional side.<br />,  <br />,  i appreciate good food (the same as absolutely everyone else around,  here: its the new "i like sunsets and long walks on the beach"),,  but by myself sometimes sink to the level of bachelor chow. (you,  get bonus points for knowing that reference.)<br />,  <br />,  i have no angry exes (i hope), stalkers, stalkees, restraining,  orders, warrants, contagions, or debt. im not an abuser,,  narcissist, drunk, addict, player, phony, or con artist. i am also,  not a genius, and at times the universe seems to enjoy reminding me,  of this.<br />,  <br />,  i think its odd and self-defeating to lie in a profile, so my age,  and height (apparently two commonly-fibbed-about areas) are,  accurate. (and "body type: average" means about 175 lbs., which,  might count as "thin" at my height and age.) when i last did online,  dating (13 years ago!), several women said "you really are six feet,  tall!" well, yeah... why would i want your first impression of me,  in person to be: "he lied about his height"?<br />,  <br />,  politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere,,  diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies.,  groucho marx<br />,  <br />,  now for a topic sure to cause some self-filtering among my,  visitors. long ago i learned that there were both smart and stupid,  people (and well- and ill-informed and -intentioned ones) on all,  sides of nearly every controversy, that all ideologies contain at,  least a germ of truth, and that all become tedious, absurd, and,  dangerous when applied at 100% strength to everything. im looking,  for someone who, whatever their beliefs, understands what i mean.,  politically im sort of a moderate <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=libertarian">libertarian</a>, which means i avoid,  dogmatism, dont fit neatly on the left/right scale, believe in the,  virtues (and limits) of liberty and voluntary association and,  spontaneous order, have an innate wariness toward large and,  powerful organizations (and the people who want to replace or,  destroy them), and that my life doesnt revolve around politics. i,  enjoy spirited discussions, but only with people who can do so in a,  spirit of fun and exploration, without rancorous dogmatism,,  name-calling, and simple-minded cheerleading for your particular,  team. whether with allies or opponents, a good discussion should be,  more "socratic learning/tennis match between friends" and less,  "death struggle with the duped servants of evil." in other words,,  if you are a doctrinaire partisan who believes your side (whatever,  that is) has a monopoly on insight and virtue and the facts, im,  probably not your guy. in the immortal words of sergeant hulka:,  "lighten up, francis."<br />,  <br />,  i admit to homebody tendencies, but it wont be hard to get me to,  go somewhere. (well, except to a sporting event.) a park, a museum,,  an art show, a new restaurant, a party, a flea market, being near,  or in nature or water: all fun with good company. i really do need,  to get away from the computer more often....',

      "i live in the lake merritt area of oakland. i moved to ca a little,  over a year ago after finishing grad school in wi in engineering.,  im originally from the st. louis area of southern il. so far ca,  has been a nice change of pace from the midwest, but i still enjoy,  getting back to st. louis and chicago to visit family and,  friends.<br />,  <br />,  most of my time is spent either working or at the gym on weekdays.,  weekends i like to go to the farmers market near my place and then,  just see what else is available. usually dont pack my weekends too,  full, but i like to try new things and see various parts of the bay,  area and northern ca. i dont drink much coffee or alcohol, so the,  best way to motivate me to hang out is to come up with some new,  activity or place to see. i also like to rock climb when i get a,  chance, and ive done a lot of martial arts and sparring in the,  past and am thinking about finding a low key sparring gym to join,  since its one of the most intense and active workouts ive ever,  found.<br />,  <br />,  im also getting ready for the tough mudder in tahoe in sept, so,  hit me up if you have any training tips.",

      "where do i begin? i was born in ny and driven to ca at age 2. lived,  in so. ca. until i was 21 when i moved to sf and then marin. i,  truly love this area with all its diversity. the outdoors is my,  playground whether i am active or still.<br />,  (hiking,walking,kayaking, bicycling, bird watching,camping, gazing,  at the mountains or ocean). my car particularly knows its way up,  and down the coast and all the sweet beautiful spots along the way.,  i was afraid of water for a long time as i was caught in a riptide,  as a child. i am moving through that fear and am making up for all,  the activities i never did. for example, i pet a baby whale in baja,  last year and also swam with the manatees in florida. i am,  snorkeling now and would like to sail. i am not obsessed with any,  of these activities but they all help me feel especially vibrant,  and bring me much joy. i feel a very spiritual connection in and,  with nature. in general i engage in many things i love. i work part,  time as a counselor (individuals and groups ) and i gain energy,  from my job. i spend time with good friends and family and also,  like my own company. i read a lot and like the arts. i am growing,  tomatoes and lettuce in my garden for the first time. i love many,  kinds of music especially jazz. i love to share my passions with,  others and learn new ones from them. honesty, kindness and intimate,  conversations are important to me. i love animals and have two,  sister kittens and sometimes sit overnight with dog pals.",

      '1/2012: i just answered a logic question wrong, this morning,,  thinking i was correcting a previous answer. i feel a little bad,  about this lapse of judgment... but not too bad if you can forgive,  me for occasional such missteps, read on!<br />,  <br />,  i believe in living an integrated life, finding a fugue for left-,  and right-brain expressions. i have faith in the natural world, in,  the vibrancy of our communities, and in the grace of human,  interactions and negotiations. i believe in cultivating my spark in,  the world, and in encouraging that spark in others. i have my,  moments of reflection and self-expression, in the spirit of mary,  oliver and thoreau. i am strongly opposed to fundamentalism and,  evangelism, from religious and atheist camps alike. i am a pagan, a,  beginning fan of meditation, and (after some self-examination and,  re-examinations) i identify as a person with a spiritual path. i,  understand that my path is to flirt with the unknown, and to find,  my balance in the middle of all that.<br />,  <br />,  (i also have a fun time trying to define my values, and put words,  to the ineffable. i struggle with the fact that i dont see myself,  as unreasonable or invulnerable to logic; i just believe there is,  more to my life experience than -just- logic, or -just- the,  ineffable. :) )<br />,  <br />,  my ber-frank paragraph upfront: i want to birth and raise at least,  one kid. i am embarking on how to accomplish this with my current,  friend network, planning things out, establishing committees, and,  stuff. i would live to find a co-conspirator for this kind of,  project, but at least want a partner or partners that like kids and,  the women that have them. :p (now, back to regular profile,  infoes!)<br />,  <br />,  my real self likes to smell good smells, from all sorts of things.,  i love the smell of freshly-laundered clothes, especially on myself,  or on others. i like the smell of clean hair, and skin, and,  murphys oil soap. i aim to use non-petrochemical laundry,  detergents, that tend to smell faintly like lavender, or some other,  herb. but somehow, the smell of standard detergent-cleaned clothes,  is appealing, as well: the strong chemical smell of clean, wafting,  off a person im snuggling with...nothing beats this! (even lysol,  has its charms!)<br />,  <br />,  im rather sensory based: i like the feel of things, the taste and,  texture of them, as well as the thrill of delicious smells. i love,  worn wood floors, and wooden handles, and the homes of retired,  hippies, with papasan round chairs, and bamboo. i sometimes see,  sound as color; i get very emotional when faced with striking,,  sweeping music or dance. <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=sean+dorsey">sean dorsey</a>, mark morris: i love,  modern dance, and art. <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=olafur+eliasson">olafur eliasson</a> makes me,  <i>grin</i>...<br />,  <br />,  i like eating delicious, particular foods from a foodie friends,  kitchen. i love the feel and smell of hand lotions, and essential,  oils.<br />,  <br />,  folk dance is a big part of my life -- contra dance and scottish,  country especially -- and i am drawn very much to folk music,,  especially fiddles.<br />,  <br />,  i like <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=indie+comic+books">indie,  comic books</a>, singalong <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=music">music</a> and all sorts of <a class="ilink",  href="/interests?i=crafts">crafts</a>. i love the <a class="ilink",  href="/interests?i=arts">arts</a> and most dance forms. i am,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=queer">queer</a>, <a class=,  "ilink" href="/interests?i=bi">bi</a>, <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=polyamorous">polyamorous</a>, even if i mostly date,  one person at a time, <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=feminist">feminist</a> and a quiet <a class="ilink",  href="/interests?i=pagan">pagan</a>. im a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=health+education">health education</a> advocate,,  too.<br />,  <br />,  i claim as friends and soul-siblings the <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=radical+faeries">radical faeries</a> community from,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=short+mountain+sanctuary">short,  mountain sanctuary</a> in tennessee. i learned how to crochet and,  knit from queer boys at this rural commune. i relearned knitting,  about 4 years ago, from a nice swedish lady on bart.<br />,  <br />,  im an unabashed <b>morning person</b>. love the taste of caffe,  latte, but dont have a caffeine habit. i like kukicha and earl,  grey, on rare caffeinated moments.<br />,  <br />,  soy de miami, viviendo en oakland, california para como 7 aos,  ahora. me gusta mucho el espaol de mxico/california...puedo,  entenderlo ms facil!<br />,  <br />,  pues, usualmente estoy usando espaol solamente en trabajo, pero es,  un parte de m identidad....para ser una mujer, una gringa de,  miami, aprendiendo culturas diferentes y disfrutando las personas,  quines yo encuentro.<br />,  <br />,  je parle un peu de francais, dune voyage france lhiver,  2006....paris, bretagne, et la cathedral de chartres, avec le,  labyrinth trs magnifique et trs vieux. enfin, les cits de,  strausbourg et luxembourg. jaime les "puddings" de danon, mais non,  les "keyboards" de la eu. :p<br />,  <br />,  jai les settings pour les accents! trs bien. jai des amis,  franaise quebeois. maintenant, japprends quelque chose,  canadienne franaise...poutine, le slang de quebec, et les ftes.,  :p avec chance, je vais aprendre franais plus vite, plus vite,,  plus vite...<br />,  <br />,  i am grinning, heartfelt, and watching out.',

      'hello and thanks for stopping by to take a glance. admittedly, i,  was a stubborn subscriber to the notion that i could only meet that,  special someone organically through shared interests and that,  internet dating was great for other people but not right for me.,  but, as i continue to meet happy couples who have discovered each,  other online i had to ask myself why i couldnt be one of those,  other people.<br />,  <br />,  sohere it goes<br />,  <br />,  with either friends or romantic interests, i believe that you do,  people a disservice by not being honest and forthright with them. i,  appreciate that type of integrity and transparency in return and it,  has proven itself to be a valuable sniff test. this probably,  explains why i dont like to stew over things so youll never have,  to second guess what im thinking or feeling. its also useful if i,  somehow didnt notice the hem of my skirt didnt quite make its way,  all the way down my backside before i walked out of a public,  restroom.<br />,  <br />,  im less interested in what job you have or what titles you hold,  and more interested in what you do in your free time and what,  things we could enjoy doing together. maybe we spend the winter,  skiing at as many different locations as we can? how many trails or,  national parks can we hike over a summer? maybe you can help me put,  those surf lessons to good use or accompany me with whatever,  instrument you play while i put my guitar lessons to good,  use?<br />,  <br />,  i realized when i reread my what im doing with my life section,  that because i do a lot of outdoor activities, it could give,  someone the impression that i dress mostly in cotton and carry my,  wallet in the back pocket of my jeans. but, with the exception of,  running errands or rolling out of bed on a weekend to the nearest,  greasy spoon for brunch, i was raised to "give em something nice,  to look at" when you leave the house.<br />,  <br />,  there is nothing like disappointment to remind you that youre,  living and, no doubt, if youre breathing youve experienced it. i,  hope that how ive handled and grown from it differentiates me from,  the masses and that it comes in useful when you need someone to,  help get you through a bad day by having an ice bucket of beers and,  a foot massage waiting for you when you get home.<br />,  <br />,  some of the questions on this website make me shiver but, with the,  person i trust, no question is too private. i am reserved when,  necessary and expressive and uninhibited when appropriate.<br />,  <br />,  a little bit about you:<br />,  your quiet confidence allows you to command attention from a room,  without demanding it and you appreciate that presence in your,  match. your discretion, humility and intuition tell you that it,  takes much more than a pretty face and a couple of things in common,  to create a relationship and your search for the one may have,  even made you feel, at times, like she doesnt actually exist. but,  you know its right when youve found someone who can finish your,  sentences for you because youre so tuned in to each other and,  entire conversations ensue using the secret language that you,  invented together.<br />,  <br />,  you find beauty in internal qualities, arent ruled by precise,,  physical requirements and realize that chemistry is an happy,  accident. you trust that things will happen as they may and open,  yourself up to it, freely.',

      "i suppose i should be slightly more positive sounding.<br />,  <br />,  i am a tomboy. this means im one of the boys. i wear mens pants,  because i find them more practical and comfortable. all my friends,  are men. if you are *interested* in me, then you must be ok with,  this. i am not the girlfriend who has a home-cooked meal ready for,  you when you get home. i will only do your laundry if i have to do,  mine and yours happens to be in the same hamper. i will never clean,  your mess. a lot of guys claim that they dont mind this but,  usually in the end it turns out that they do. i am incredibly,  vulgar, burp and fart loudly, sit with my legs apart, slouch, smoke,  endless cigarettes, and am covered in tattoos. i do a lot of shit,  talking and laugh at people in insulting ways. i *hate* flowers as,  gifts. i dont see the point of greeting cards.<br />,  <br />,  if some feminine aspects must be noted, then i like pictures of,  insanely cute kittens. my hair is very long. i wish my boobs were,  bigger.<br />,  <br />,  i find conversations about gross bodily functions hilarious,,  especially if theyre gross and sexual at the same time. tmi is,  me.<br />,  <br />,  i dont care about humankind in general. i have very few close,  friends and those few i treat as my family. i have countless casual,  acquaintances. apparently political beliefs are deal-breakers for,  most guys, so i will say this now: i do not follow any specific,  party, my world beliefs are very cold-heartedly fair. so if youre,  very strongly politically inclined and require your girl to be,  also, then you want to stay away from me. if you require your girl,  to deeply feel pity and sadness whenever theres a natural,  disaster, then you want to stay away from me. if you require your,  girl to donate to charities, you want to stay away from me.<br />,  <br />,  i am bitter, jaded, grumpy, and overall a pessimistic person. if,  you require a girl who is cheerful and has a positive outlook on,  life like a ray of sunshine, then ill just laugh at you.<br />,  <br />,  i have spent a number of years dealing with alcoholics, stupid,  drunks, and otherwise intoxicated folk. this has given me extremely,  low tolerance for such habits. if you like to get wasted on a,  weekly basis, then im not going to like you. if you smoke pot,  incessantly, then im not going to like you. apparently all guys,  who have 80%+ match rates with me smoke a ton of pot. if you like,  to do hard drugs, then....<br />,  <br />,  i am a night person. if you wake me up in the morning you will piss,  me off. ive held a variety of jobs, mostly in manual labor and,  customer service (funny, i know, i hate people). basically the,  point is to keep me away from a desk. i quit berkeley to avoid the,  desk. i really dislike the corporate job structure and how people,  behave within it. i dont care if you have it, but just know that i,  hate it and understand why i do.<br />,  <br />,  i have a very cruel sense of humor where the more the person is,  suffering the more i laugh. especially if its due to their,  stupidity.<br />,  <br />,  i can give the cold shoulder and basically it takes a lot to break,  down my barriers, but once theyre down then i will do a lot for,  you. i dont like to hug friends but i want my boyfriend to cuddle,  me as much as possible.<br />,  <br />,  i dont show much enthusiasm, i dont like to give nor receive,  high-fives. i dont give compliments and i dont expect any.,  generally it is very difficult to apologize to me.<br />,  <br />,  i dont have very high self esteem but i have high self-confidence.,  basically i know i lack in a lot of areas but i am fine with that,,  take it or leave it. i dont know why youd be attracted to me in,  any way, but if you are then for christs sake dont complain to me,  about how i dont smile enough.<br />,  <br />,  my experience tells me that if a guy is too much like me then the,  relationship will fail. but for some reason i keep getting messages,  from guys with less than 60% match rates. this just tells me that,  theyre just desperate for blowjobs. i definitely dont want a,  clone, but theres gotta be some basis of connection.",

      'a rose by any other name....<br />,  its hard for anyone to describe what makes them who they are.,  maybe its my unique sense of humor. the fact that i laugh when i,  think something is funny; regardless of where i am, i laugh loud,  and from the heart. but really, dont we all have "unique" sense of,  humor? maybe my heart? im a good person; i try to make others as,  comfortable as possible around me, and help others out who need it.,  i put other peoples needs before my own sometimes, something i am,  actually trying to not do so often. unless im driving- then its,  me first... always. it could be my quirkiness. like a typical,  female i love fashion and shoes, but i also love poker and comic,  books. i hate cooking, love grocery shopping. love the gap and,  grungy vintage stores. rock show and country concerts. but really,,  its none of these. its my right elbow. my right elbow makes me,  who i am.<br />,  i admire manners, and people who treat others with respect. im,  extremely independent, and work hard for what i have in life. i,  love anything that has its own style and personality. i enjoy,  theater, rock concerts, book readings, wine tasting... pretty much,  anything interesting and fun. im still searching for what i want,  out of life, but i have a feeling im on the right path.<br />,  im looking for that connection... the one person you need to run,  up to and kiss when you see them. im hoping that person turns out,  to be funny and smart. self-depreciating, but confident deep down.,  adventurous and spontaneous, but sees the fun in a quiet movie,  night also. im looking for someone who is just as open to the,  world around us as i am. we dont have to have the exact same,  interests; part of the fun of meeting someone new is showing your,  favorite niches in the area.<br />,  <br />,  i am strong, clever, and rambunctious',

      'hanging out with me is <i>a lot</i> like doing so with a labrador,  retriever. like the lab im sorely lacking in worldliness, devoid,  of urban sophistication and by no means the,  sharpest-knife-in-the-drawer. on the other hand, i compensate with,  a good-natured core thats easily amused and ready to scramble on a,  moments notice. you can easily steer me towards any desired,  destination, but gimme the lead theres no telling where well wind,  up. i respond well to simple suggestions like "walk", "drink", or,  "eat", but if you mention anything along the lines of the symphony,,  fusion cuisine, or post-modernist art youll get little more than a,  puzzled look and a quizzical tilt of the head.<br />,  <br />,  im better at listening than talking, gravitate towards,  neighborhood and/or dive bars rather than trendy lounges, and,  prefer deep one-on-one conversation rather than chatting sparsely,  amidst a big group. more blue-jeans-and-cotton-hoodie than sport,  coat and slacks, and craves half-pound burgers rather than haute,  cuisine. savors lifes simple pleasures while (usually) eschewing,  costly indulgences. i keep a low profile, avoiding excessive,  attention while giving a wide berth to people who thrive on it.,  commonly found in the company of the elderly, the married, the,  rich-of-heart and the poor-of-spirit yet noticeably absent from any,  assemblage of the young-and-the-beautiful. i truly enjoy,  socializing with mankind, despite having what charles bukowski once,  described as "a terrible itch for solitude". half latent child,,  rapt with simple pleasures, natures wonders, and the inner workings,  of all things mechanical. half wizened curmudgeon, still subject to,  whims of the flesh yet mindful of natural laws regarding foolish,  actions and unforeseen consequences. logical and pragmatic on the,  outside.....but deeply introspective and emotional within.<br />,  <br />,  and lastly, despite tending a lowly spot on the economic totem pole,  of the snazzy neighborhood wherein i dwell (noe valley, if youre,  curious), i never cease to be thankful for what i have, what i do,,  and for the fact that i get to live in this most <i>kickass</i> of,  cities...<br />,  <br />,  footnote:if youre taking the trouble to write and your expectation,  is for myself to drive to where you live, please, be somewhat,  near-by...meaning south of san rafael, north of san mateo, and west,  of the caldecott tunnel....perhaps farther if we can meet near a,  bart station. ive been contacted by plenty of perfectly nice,  people that live farther away, and my track record for coordinating,  with them is presently running around 2-for-19. also, you need to,  be in decent physical shape. if you arent, its highly doubtful,  that youll be able to hang with me.',

(okay, maybe that was,  uncalled for. maybe.) im (very) occasionally known to replace my,  entire vocabulary with four letter words, sometimes for minutes on,  end. this usually follows a heated, and <b>often hilarious</b>,  rant. i didnt realize how much i actually swore till someone,  pointed it out to me. the most appropriate response <i>at the,  time</i> i could come up with was, "well, fuck, dude." that said,,  im capable of keeping a clean mouth at least 8 hours out of the,  day, and around children. no holds barred after 9pm, though.<br />,  <br />,  my profile currently indicates that im straight, but if labels,  are required, id fit the title of <b><a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=heteroflexible">heteroflexible</a></b> a bit closer.,  okay, maybe hetero(very)flexible. ill warn ya straight up as,  well-- im not a manly man oozing testosterone, and i damn well,  plan to keep it that way. if youre looking for an all-american,  image of man im not your guy. oh, and for the love of mike, dont,  try to change me. if i feel the need or urge to change, itll,  happen. just remember, <b>im not your toy, mmkay? mmkay.</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>so, what am i looking for?</b><br />,  before you get into all this stuff, im mainly looking to increase,  my friend base. <b>i need more people to chill and game with.</b> i,  dont care what youre playing. i <i>might</i> even play d&amp;d,  4th, if i <i>have to</i>. if i -have- to. itd also be cool to meet,  more nightlifey people. i spent three years working and going to,  school, instead of exploring like i should have been. :x i need,  nighttime escapes! know of any good bars or shows? tell me! drag,  me! force me! quietly suggest! anything! (especially if they need,  workers :p) if you know about any raves going on in the bay area,  (bonus points if you can supply a ride? :p) poke at me.<br />,  <br />,  well, if you made it this far, by all means, <b>keep going.</b>,  odds are, ill probably like ya. anyways, as you can see from my,  sidebar, im looking for <b>new friends, long-term and short-term,  dating, activity partners, long distance pen pals,</b> and <b>sex,  partners.</b> (i do hate the term casual encounters. sounds like,  were going for coffee and a donut. we can, though. speaking of,  which, i know a sweet place in the mission to get a shit ton of,  <b>free donuts.</b> more about that later.)<br />,  <br />,  <b>new friends:</b> yes, im looking for new friends. im a very,  open and personal kind of guy, and i like my friends to feel close.,  i dont believe in having emotionless friendship, and i like to be,  emotionally connected to my friends on some level. <b>this does not,  mean that i want committed relationships from my friends or,  anything of the sort.</b> i simply believe that if friends cant,  trust each other with their emotions, they could just as well be,  strangers passing each other on the street. emotional connections,  are what i believe separate friends from acquaintances. friends,  empower each other-- they build each other up. occasionally,,  friends have issues. it happens. they get over it. needless to say,,  i dont like sugar-coating life. oh, and dont watch what ya say,,  <b>tmis lost its authority around me. i dont have much of a,  personal bubble, either.</b> im just warning you long in advance.,  i do respect your bubble, though. :)<br />,  <br />,  <b>long term dating:</b> how long is long term per se? weeks?,  months? years? honestly, <b>if im still dating someone after six,  months and we havent moved to either a friend or relationship,  status, well, thats probably the end of the "long term,  dating"</b>. im not the master of romance, but i am a romantic. i,  am on a dating site after all. <b>if youre looking to date purely,  for sex, id highly advise you look on my sex partner sections.,  ;)</b> if you think youve got an interest, please send a message,  :). also, please, please, please, (really, please.) dont confuse,  my asking to hang out as asking you on a date. also, dont assume,  that because we hang out that we are dating. <b>i also tend to lean,  rather heavily toward polyamory.</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>short term dating:</b> this is pretty much the same thing as the,  above, so im not going to bother writing another block of,  stuff.<br />,  <br />,  <b>activity partners</b>: im down to meet up and try anything,,  rock climbing, biking, swimming, drawing, whatever. just give me,  fair warning, eh? if youve got a <b>moped</b> id love to blast,  with you.<br />,  <br />,  <b>long distance pen pals:</b> so what if you live a few states,  away? i love talking to people who generally want to befriend me.,  that said, if were going to talk, <b>please be literate. this goes,  for anyone i talk to.</b> while i might say things like, "y hello,  thar," or ,"teh fhecks you doin?", that doesnt mean i dont like,  full, literate conversations. as you can see from reading this,  profile, (shit, you are still reading, arent you?) i like to be,  well spoken, and i cant stand too much of, "hey, wuts good? im,  chillin @ home wer r u?" no offense to people to who text talk, but,  i just cant stand to read it too long. a little bits okay, i just,  dont want to have to decipher what the fuck youre trying to,  say.<br />,  <br />,  <b>sex partners: before you make assumptions,</b> just because i am,  <i>also</i> seeking sex partners does not mean i am <i>only</i>,  seeking sex partners. now, i said i hate the term casual,  encounters but that doesnt mean i like sex partners either. i,  like to bundle this term loosely with friends because if i just,  plain dont like someone im having sex with and that doesnt,  change, im probably not going to have sex with that person much,  longer. i prefer that my partners are at least friends. now for my,  ever-present, "<b>this does not in any way, shape, form, or,  definition mean that we are dating or in a committed,  relationship.</b>" friends can have sex. in my opinion, theres,  nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure with a friend. and... the,  nitty gritty. <b>i am completely std free, and i am tested,  regularly.</b> obviously, you should be too. condoms are a must. i,  definitely believe in safe and sane play, and id really prefer,  anyone who is seeking sex be capable of having open communication,  about it. ya know, stuff like what works, what doesnt, boundaries,,  etc. <b>while i like to say im experienced (i certainly think i,  am, and ive had no complaints), there is a lot that i havent,  tried, so creativity is a big plus. im willing to try almost,  anything.</b> in case you cant tell, <b>im not a boy,  scout.</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>remember that part about tmi having lost authority?</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>as a general note, any time youre uncomfortable or have,  something on your mind that you want to tell me, let me know. id,  rather you risk my feelings be hurt than disappear over something,  that could just be resolved in an adult fashion.</b><br />,  <br />,  ***<br />,  <br />,  <b>other things im interested in</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>geminis:</b> as you can see, im a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=gemini">gemini</a> and very serious about it. whats,  this mean? <b>well, if youve ever read a personality profile for a,  gemini, its correct.</b> both the good and the bad. now, geminis,,  what does this mean for you? im wary of you. <b>oh, am i wary of,  you.</b> no offense, but i know myself. (yeah, i know youre,  giggling right now because youre thinking of yourself and going,,  "oooooooh.. teehee" <b>im onto your ass.</b>) at the same time, i,  love you and embrace you with more open arms than possibly anyone,  else. <b>if its a friendship youre after, you got it, if its a,  date, sure, if its a relationship, im a little cautious, but you,  know exactly why, and if its sex, its probably gonna happen at,  the drop of a hat.</b><br />,  <br />,  <b>dragons (chinese zodiac):</b> because of your likely brazen,,  bold, and firm nature, as well as my brazen, bold, and firm nature,  <b>its a likelihood that we will argue and compete a lot.</b>,  thats not a bad thing though. its good to be able to defend a,  stance against someone youre already friends with. <b>strangers,  may not exchange the time of day, but friends can argue for hours,  and still be happy.</b><br />,  <br />,  ***<br />,  <br />,  <b>a few other things</b><br />,  <br />,  so, this section was an afterthought. heres a few random,  things.<br />,  <br />,  -stephen colbert is a man-like demigod. (among men)<br />,  <br />,  -id be a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=capoeirista">capoeirista</a> if i stopped being so,  damned lazy.<br />,  <br />,  -id be a tracuer if i started running again.<br />,  <br />,  -i really want a <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=purp">purp</a>,  bong.<br />,  <br />,  -id make my own clothes if i still had a sewing machine and all,  the supplies i needed.<br />,  <br />,  -im easier to understand with a fake, generic british or irish,  accent. either is 10x better with a cigarette in my mouth.<br />,  <br />,  -my hometown is <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=monrovia">monrovia</a>, california. i dont plan on,  going back for more than a weekend at a time.<br />,  <br />,  -i feel like my profile seems extra serious. :x<br />,  <br />,  so, youre still reading. <b>i am impressed.</b> if ive noticed,  youre reading my profile, im probably doing the same to yours by,  now.<br />,  <br />,  i am charismatic, spontaneous, and possibly a superhero',
