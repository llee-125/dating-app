so scarce as,  to be almost nowhere to be found, despite the assertions of so many,  who lay claim to the title. but they are hijackers, claiming their,  definition is the only true definition.<br />,  <br />,  here are some other quotes i like:<br />,  if youre going to walk on thin ice, you may as well dance ,  anon<br />,  "you were once wild here. dont let them tame you!" - isadora,  duncan<br />,  "dance, when youre broken open. dance, if youve torn the bandage,  off. dance in the middle of the fighting. dance in your blood.,  dance when youre perfectly free." - mawlana jalal-al-din,  rumi<br />,  dont ask yourself what the world needs;

is it supporting us in being who we want to be? can we,  make adjustments to see that it does and are we willing to do so?,  whether for a week, a month, a year or decades, i come into,  relationship when the two of us believe and experience that doing,  so takes us closer to our values. i end relationship when i do not,  see or experience this for both people. i do not consider death to,  be a failure and appreciate the vitality that comes from honestly,  exploring the question: does spending time together each day bring,  us more value than any other thing we could be doing? if not, why,  not? are we ok with that or do we want to reinvent our relationship,  so that it does? immediacy is a very high value of mine. something,  that is true and gets communicated while im feeling it is a great,  experience. within the next 24 hours its ok and beyond that it,  begins to feel stale and intimacy starts to diminish.<br />,  <br />,  appreciation and affection: my first three love languages in this,  order are: words of praise, quality time and touch. to feel loved i,  need verbal appreciation, spacious time to connect and touch.,  because i get a fairly good read on someone within a few hours i am,  often fairly fast with affection if i feel safe and it is nice to,  be met there. i enjoy leisurely relationships in which we take the,  time each day to appreciate what we love about one another and to,  enjoy sexual and sensual affection. i notice that i dont have a,  courting and honeymoon stage that wears off. i am just as,  affectionate several years into a relationship as i am at the,  beginning sometimes more so because i get turned on more by,  emotional closeness than i do by anything else.<br />,  <br />,  personal growth and spirituality: i am passionate about learning,  exceptional relationship skills and have published several books on,  the subject as part of my own education (i learn best by teaching).,  it was an incredible discovery when i experienced natural sacred,  states of insight and consciousness arising out of bringing our,  energy bodies into love-making. i have learned so much in the past,  eight years since i made relationship skills the focus of my,  life-long learning program. i want to meet someone who shares my,  passion to learn and experience new things on all dimensions. i,  have always found i learn best with beginners mind. i appreciate,  you for joining me there.', ethnicity: 'white', height: 73, income: 80000, job: 'artistic / musical / writer', location: 'san rafael, california', offspring: 'doesnt want kids', orientation: 'straight', pets: 'likes dogs', religion: 'other and very serious about it', sex: 'men', sign: 'capricorn but it doesn&rsquo;t matter', smokes: 'no', speaks: 'english (fluently)', status: 'single', profile_image: 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/86.jpg',},
